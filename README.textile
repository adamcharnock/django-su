h1. Installation

h2. Step 1: settings.py

Add @django_su@ to @INSTALLED_APPS@. Make sure you put it *before* @django.contrib.admin@.

h2. Step 2: urls.py

Add this to your root @urls.py@ file:

<code>url(r"^", include("django_su.urls")),</code>

And that should be it!

h2. Usage

Go and view a user in the admin interface and look for a new 'Login as' button in the top right.

Once you have su'ed into a user, you can get exit back into your original user by navigating to @/su/@ in your browser.
